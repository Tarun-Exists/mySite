            <p>This is not some random horse. This is a real horse with a some real life and a real name. He is THE JUAN. He is so nic :D he must be somewhere out there grazing the grasslands. But sadly he was once stuck in a balcony :( people literally clicked a horse at his lowest point of life and cared more about taking a picture rather than helping him... things like these... make me cry everytime :( <br><i>*starts crying*</i><br>oh and fyi <i>*still sobbing*</i> that juan is clickable</p>

    <h3>About Me :)</h3>
    <p>Here's literally nothing about me go to contacts to get to my LinkedIn profile. This is a real random paragraph real random...well.. nothing Much to add here. Because I can't let my brain flow publicly... not because it's offensive... but more like it'd be awkward and mostly make no sense at all. Plus I just don't want this paragraph go like lorem ipsum dolor sit amet and all thing... oh but wait I guess VS Code has this functionality... I might try it later... but I have a lot to say so I don't really need it. Plus my typing speed is real nice so it'd not take much of a time... although people you are still running out of time reading all this literal gibberish ... just a friendly reminder it was... ehhh... yet you're here... okay you're still here... cOoL. I mean... between you and me, it's cool :D we're cool we toit i fw you heavy... just can't let the gang know. Ehhh now I feel like I have started to run out of words... I don't really know how this is even possible... lemme just try to act drunk and get lost in my thought-loops ... that might work... anddddd I can sense... it's been a while since I used a full stop... I mean not in the sense of an awkward break... like this one... and this one... but more like a real full stop like end of the sentence dottt kinda way... anyways... let it be... ehhh okay fine and I have a life so dang it and here we go.... DOT. Oh and btw I realised I used ... instead of . where I was supposed to use . instead of . ... D-DUCKING-OT. Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
