    <h2>My First Actually Somewhat Online Always Open Site</h2>
    <h4>not exactly anything like tarundotcom or anything like that... Just a random site</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>So... I don't know what brings you here. I'd imagine if I didn't die any earlier than I am supposed to...</p>
    <p>I mean when am I supposed to die? How am I supposed to die? Is there even anything after death...</p>
    <p>Is there anything even now? What is now? What is present? Oh god... I think I don't really need to</p>
    <p>speak that much of my mind. Right now I am in some state (nothing suic*dal dw) when getting stuck in</p>
    <p>a loop of thoughts is easier than ever before. Is it because I am going through some phase? or is it</p>
    <p>because I am kinda high because my dopamine intake is higher than ever before. I don't do sh*t all day</p>
    <p>I just keep blaming myself and watch movies series talk to friends go out with friends and all that.</p>
    <p>Never-you-mind... where was I? Yes....what brings you here? I'd imagine if I didn't die any earlier</p>
    <p>than I am supposed to (probably in the mid 2070s staring at the sun through some limousine-kinda glass</p>
    <p>idk Never-you-mind) If I didn't die any earlier I can guess you're not just me who brought himself as</p>
    <p>a regular visit to my site or revisiting my old memories (that'd be sad... I need the world to be curious</p>
    <p>about my childhood). World knowing me is not enough... they need to see the world how my eyes see it.</p>
    <p>anyways... I won't even care about any punctuation anymore dang it.</p>
    <p>Oh god do I sound suicidal? I am not...please! I am just a bit effed up. Now a days things are not cool.</p>
    <p>It just feels like I am rewriting all the philosophies life principles whole pattern of my conscience</p>
    <p>all over again from the scratch. Need to fix a few things. Stuck in a daily-life-loop. Really need to fix it.</p>
    <p>Anyways that is it. For now I mean. I hope we can edit all this later...If I revisit :) </p>
